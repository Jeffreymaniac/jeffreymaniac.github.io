  <h1>Requests/ commisions (Read this if I make a website for u)</h1>
  <p style="color:gray;">So if Im making a website for you, I probably sent you this link, which is probably why you're here (unless you clicked this link in the articles section).</p>
  <p>These are some rules and terms for you if I am making a website for you. If you want to ask me to make a website for you, email me at <a href="mailto:jeffreyrb03@gmail.com">jeffreyrb03@gmail.com</a>. If any other address emails you, it is a fake.</p>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>I don't wanna make an inappropriate website like for adult content or shock sites. Ask somebody else to do that.</li>
  <li>I'm not going to make a super big/ambitious project without something in return. By a big project I mean something like a social media website like Tiktok or a shopping website or something that's gonna stress me out. I wouldn't exactly be the guy to go to to make sites like that, although I'm capable, it's a lot of hard work which I'd need something in return for like a gift card or something idk. Things like that would also require you to provide me with the things nessecary for it, like databases to store social media posts and API keys for whatever extra functionality you'd like and whatnot. I can give pointers if you need help with stuff like that or picking a good option.</li>
  <li>You will need to give me access to whatever you want to use to make your website so that I can make what you ask me to make. For example, if you want <span style="color:blue;"><em>your-username</em>.github.io</span>, then make your own Github account and invite me to it as a collaborator. If you already have a URL, then give me stuff like the a name or whatever so that I can use either Glitch, Replit, or Github to develop it. Ultimately it is your responsibility to provide me with some stuff to make your site for you.</li>
    <li>The bullet point above doesn't apply if you are just asking me for code that you'll put into your website yourself, like if you just need help with an issue in JavaScript and you need me to fix the error then I have no problem with that!</li>
    <li>You have to credit me for my work on your site(s) and/or when using my code. Usually I'll put a notice at the bottom of the website that says "Made by Jeff/JaecadeJnight" with a link to my website. You may move it around and make it smaller but you may not delete it or style it so that it's invisible. You may also move it to a credits page or something like that, but it needs to be easy for people accessing your site to know that I made it.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Payment</h2>
  <p>Im just doing this for fun so don't worry I'll probably start charging when I'm an adult and/or I start getting lots of requests.</p>
