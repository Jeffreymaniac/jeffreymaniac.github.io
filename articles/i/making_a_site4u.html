  <p style="color:gray;">So if I am am making a website for you, I probably sent you this link, which is probably why you're here (unless you clicked this link in the articles section).</p>
  <p>These are some rules and terms for you if I am making a website for you. If you want to ask me to make a website for you, email me at <a href="mailto:jeffreyrb03@gmail.com">jeffreyrb03@gmail.com</a>. If any other address emails you, it is a fake.</p>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>I will not make an inappropriate website. By that I mean won't make anything with blood, s*x, or anything else.</li>
  <li>I can't make a social media website like Tiktok or something. I don't know how to make sites like that because they require servers with terabytes worth of storage due to social media sites having so many pages.</li>
  <li>I can't make a shopping website or something.</li> 
  <li>You will need to make your own Github account and invite me to it as a collaborator. Then, tell me what you want the website to look like. Your URL for your site will be something like <span style="color:blue;"><em>your-username</em>.github.io</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Payment</h2>
  <p>- Haha just kidding its free just dont be mean to me</p>
