    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of hobbies and I'm listing the ones I'm most skilled at below</p>


    <h2>Skills</h2>
      <h3>Programming/computers</h3>
    <p>I have above average computer literacy skills, know how the internet works (with HTTP requests and all), how to use a text editor, how to use files, all that good stuff.</p>
    <p>Experienced with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, and Scratch. I am new to the GDevelop game engine.</p>
    <p>I can also make Turbowarp extensions and know somewhat about the inner workings of Scratch (like the runtime and opcodes).</p>
<p>I can understand python but can't write stuff beyond print() without needing to copy&amp;paste from a tutorial. If I tried I could learn it but I dont feel like it yet.</p>
    <p>I hate Java with every bone in my body, why <code>System.out.printLn("I hate this language");</code> when in Python it's just: <code>print("hello")</code>!?!?!? The language might be good in other aspects but that was just awful and made me quit regardless.</p>
    <h3>Art/drawing</h3>
    <p>I can draw and make art very well. I'm not all that great with landscapes though, and I like to draw characters and people more. I draw like kinda anime style. If you'd like art from me then I'd like something in return! Maybe even art for art since I can't receive money yet. Idk youd have to contact me (and see my rules too)</p>
  <h3>Cooking</h3>
  <p>i can use a toaster and air fryer (not skilled)</p>
    <h3>Super Smash Bros</h3>
    <p>I play alot and I'm not sure how I would describe my skill level. I don't want to be arrogant, and I do lose quite a lot, so I'll just leave this part like this until I start consistently winning</p>
    <p>I main: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Toon Link - my best character and first main</li>
      <li>Pikachu (always the lucha libre/wrestler skin) - I SD alot with Pikachu</li>
      <li>Luigi</li>
      <li>Isabelle - im dangerous with Isabelle lol</li>
      <li>Link </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Brawlhalla</h3>
    <p>My username is willowywave4392 and I play on PS4. My ELO is 1238 as of writing. I main Hattori and (sometimes use) Diana, and I have absolutely no idea how you use those triangle rocket weapons so I'd likely be screwed with some characters.</p>
